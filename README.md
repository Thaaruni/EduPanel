# 📚 EduPanel - SpringBoot Backend App
EduPanel is a backend API built for a lecturer management web application. It enables administrators to manage lecturer profiles, including their personal information, LinkedIn profiles, and profile pictures. The API supports operations such as creating, retrieving, and updating lecturer records using RESTful endpoints. Profile pictures are stored locally and served through public URLs.
